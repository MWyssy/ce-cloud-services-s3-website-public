# Cloud Services - Amazon S3 Exercise

This repository provides a task for trying one of the AWS services - specifically the [Simple Storage Service (S3)](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/).

You will use the S3 service to upload and store files, specifically HTML files, and then configure the storage bucket to serve back a website üôå

## Scenario

Amazon S3 is used to store files. For example you might have an application that allows people to upload videos or photos. S3 would be a good choice for where those files are stored.

S3 can also be used to store files associated with creating a website such as HTML, CSS, images etc. It can be further configured to serve back those files and present them as a website much like a web server.

In this scenario, you will be doing just that. Creating an S3 bucket, uploading HTML and CSS to that bucket and configuring the bucket to serve back a static website.

## Pre-requisites

- An AWS account that you can access via the AWS web console
- Knowledge of your username and password for your AWS account
